# Resume Classica
A small, classic resume template that uses
[Awesome CV][awesome-cv] as a backend but simplifies the layout significantly. Includes, as an example, my own resume.

Note that the example uses functionality available only in my fork of Awesome
CV. The included Makefile can optionally download the class from my fork to the
current directory before compilation.
